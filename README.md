`Distributed network-based event emitter for NodeJS`

----------------------------------------------------

## Installing

Installing `happening` is as simple as running `npm install happening`.

Note that `happening` depends on [One](http://github.com/IndigoUnited/node-1), a distributed message queue based on [Ã˜MQ](http://zeromq.com). So, if you're having a hard time installing, refer to its [installation instructions](https://github.com/IndigoUnited/node-1#installing).

## Usage

You can use `happening` just like you would with any other event emitter. Here's a quick example:

```js
var Happening = require('happening');

happening = Happening.create(function (err) {
    if (err) {
        throw err;
    }
    
    happening.on('my_event', function (param1, param2) {
        console.log('got called with', param1, 'and', param2);
    });
    
    setInterval(function () {
        happening.emit('my_event', 'this', 'that');
    }, 500);
});
```

## Considerations

Here's a list of things you should keep in mind when using `happening`.

### Namespacing

Any emitter you create will join other emitters on the same network automatically, and act as one logical emitter. If you need multiple logical emitters, you can specify a `namespace` option:

```js
var Happening = require('happening');

happening = Happening.create({
        namespace: 'my_own_namespace'
    }, function (err) {
    if (err) {
        throw err;
    }
    
    happening.on('my_event', function (param1, param2) {
        console.log('got called with', param1, 'and', param2);
    });
    
    setInterval(function () {
        happening.emit('my_event', 'this', 'that');
    }, 500);
});
```

This emitter will only join other emitters that belong to the same `namespace`.

### Using once()

If you add `once()` listeners on two separate nodes of the emitter, both will run once. Remember that in practice, you ran `once()` twice.

### Cluster awareness

`happening` takes a few milliseconds to get up an running, which is why you have asynchronous `create()`, which will only call back once emitter has connected to at least one other node. If you want to raise the number of nodes it should wait for, you can pass a `readyThreshold` option, like so:

```js
var Happening = require('happening');

happening = Happening.create({
        readyThreshold: 3
    }, function (err) {
    if (err) {
        throw err;
    }
    
    console.log('found at least 3 nodes!');
});
```
